<!-- Whatever you write below will show up as the speaker's bio -->

Margaret Livingstone is the Takeda Professor of Neurobiology in the Harvard Medical School. She studies vision in the primate brain, specifically the area that allows object recognition: inferotemporal cortex or IT. One key question is whether these cortical domains are innate (i.e. largely encoded by a genetic program) or learned (i.e. largely created by common early experience). To answer this question, she raises juvenile macaques under different conditions (eg. the macaques are never shown certain visual categories). These early exposure manipulations dramatically change the response properties of IT neurons.
