  The limited generalization of neural networks is a critical problem for artificial intelligence, in applications ranging from automated driving and biomedical image analysis, and domains like reinforcement learning, control, and representational theory. Our goal is to address these issues by creating synergies among neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and artificial intelligence researchers that might lead to novel solutions to this problem or emphasize relevant existing classical work.
