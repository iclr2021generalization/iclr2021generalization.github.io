Because this is a virtual conference, extra effort is necessary to facilitate and encourage interactions between workshop participants. To this end, our schedule includes break-out sessions for participants to connect. We will use [Gather Town](https://gather.town/) to facilitate interaction among participants. These sessions will allow for an informal exchange of ideas and networking.

At the big tables, we suggest the following questions as starting points:
* Red table: Do we need to look at biological systems to improve generalisation?
* Green table: Are current benchmarks helpful? Which benchmarks do you like best?
* White table: What are key problems to address in order to improve out-of-distribution generalisation?
* Further, check out the bar, picnic and coffee tables!
